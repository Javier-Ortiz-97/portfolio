        I'm a self taught developer from San Diego looking to find a
        position where I can use my skills to continue to learn and grow as a
         developer. I am knowledgeable in CSS, HTML, and know basic JavaScript.
        I'm also familiar with React and I've built some personal projects
        you can check out my work below.
