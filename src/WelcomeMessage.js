      <p>
        I'm a self taught developer from San Diego looking to fill a position
        where I can develop sofware and websites. I'm knowledgeable in CSS,
        HTML, and know basic JavaScript. I'm also familiar with React and I've
        built some projects you can check out my work below.
      </p>
    </div>

export default WelcomeMessage;
